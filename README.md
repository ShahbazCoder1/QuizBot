  ```
  sudo apt-get install gettext
  ```
- On macOS (using Homebrew):
  ```
  brew install gettext
  ```
- On Windows:
  Download and install gettext from the [GNU gettext website](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)

4. Set up environment variables:

- `USERNAME`: Your Telegram Bot Username
- `API_KEY`: Your Google Generative AI API Key
- `YOUTUBE_API`: Your YouTube Data API Key

5. Set up Firebase:

## Project IDX Setup

For users working with [Google Project IDX](https://idx.google.com/), we provide a `Project-IDX_nix_setup.txt` file in the repository. This file contains the `.idx/dev.nix` configuration used in this project. To set up your Project IDX workspace:

1. Create a `.idx` directory in your Project IDX workspace if it doesn't already exist.
2. Create a `dev.nix` file inside the `.idx` directory.
3. **Copy the contents of `Project-IDX_nix_setup.txt` and paste them into your `dev.nix` file.**

This configuration sets up the necessary environment for running the Quizly bot in Project IDX, including Python and required dependencies. After setting up, you can proceed with the bot configuration and execution as described in the Setup section.

**NOTE: Remember to first clone the code from this repository to Project IDX.**

## First-Time Setup

When a user starts the bot for the first time:

1. The bot will greet the user and offer language selection
2. User selects their preferred language
3. The bot saves the user's language preference
4. User is presented with the subject selection menu to start their first quiz

## How It Works

1. The bot presents a list of subjects to choose from
2. Users enter their desired topic within the chosen subject
3. Users select the difficulty level
4. The bot generates a 10-question quiz using Google's Generative AI
5. Questions are presented one at a time as Telegram polls
6. The bot tracks correct and incorrect answers
7. After completing the quiz, users receive their final score
8. For scores of 5 or less, the bot suggests relevant YouTube videos for improvement

## Feedback

Users can submit feedback using the `/feedback` command. Feedback is sent via email to the developers.
